    <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p class="w3-center"><em>Video games, Game design, Art, Music, Sport, Film, History</em></p>
    <p>Hi, I am a Graduate at the University of Southampton in Computer Science. I love games. I like all types of games but my most favourite are competitive games involving lots of strategy, otherwise I also enjoy puzzle games, logic games, rpgs and bullet hells.
    Outside of video games, I aspire to be a game designer and developer. I wish to be a flexible developer that can work on small or large games to my freedom. I particularly enjoy studying gameplay and game design choices and intend
    on critiquing various aspects of game design choices in this blog, hopefully leading to some discussion about the insights to these choices. </p>

  	<p>I thoroughly enjoy looking at art of all kinds, I think part of making art is to be appreciated so I aspire to always appreciate the art that someone else produces great or small. I do not often
  	watch films as I would like to because I feel the modern era of films has left a lot to be desired and that they have regressed slowly away from an artform. That being said there are always gems that I
  	hope to catch, I will be discussing my thoughts, ramblings and informal reviews on here too.</p>

  		<p>On a more personal scale, I grew up fairly sheltered and was scared to meet new people but I eventually grew out of my shell when I entered my adolescence, I'm still a bit of a scaredy cat, that hasn't changed ^^.
  		I think of myself as a bit of a tradionalist, always believing in what is practical, and what is the right thing to do. I take pride in my heritage and I think others should too. I also think with an egoistic and individualistic mindset because
  		we should be the ones to control our fate, not God, and no matter what influences your choices, we are still the ones who ultimately make the final call to our destiny. My hobby is studying philosophy and ancient history with my favourite
  		areas being all classic literature, ancient civilisations and many more. Many know my favoute animal are Rabbits but I also really like Dogs and even horses. Despite this I think I am very bad with animals. I was born with rabbit as my zodiac therefore I feel a deep connection to it
  		 so much so that I would even call it destiny that I was born with this sign. I even like to gaze at the moon =O.O=.</p>

  			<p>I am intending to use this for my game ideas mostly but also as an area to put all of writing, poetry, stories and essays or other interesting things I want to talk about.
  			Classical novels feel like they are much better written than modern ones, but maybe it's because of the intended audiences, modern writers must write in colloquial ways and attempt to immediately catch the reader on a hook which
  			disappoints me. I really like the silver tongue text that classical novels have, there is a bit of elegance in the way they were written which I adore. In regards to my game ideas, I have a whole universe I dream to bring to life, to create and share with everyone.
  			The name of this world is 'Crowlion', and I wish for it to grow into the gem that I as a kid all those years ago dream't it would grow to be. It's funny how the aspirations and desires of adults usually ends up being little dreams
  			of a growing child. That's all I am going to disclose for now about Crowlion. I plan on unveiling the machinations of the world through novels and games that I am working hard to come to life. I guess finally,
  			the last thing I would like to say is, for those that are reading this, I am  grateful that you were able to see a side of me I do not show to other's, because if you are reading this out of the curiousity of your heart and
  			not by the frivolent pleads of a boy lost in his world, it means I made my dream come true, a dream not of my older self, but a dream that was anchored into my heart by my younger self, for that is the only dream I have now, the happiness for that child all those years ago.</p>
