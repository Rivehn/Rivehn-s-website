    <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p class="w3-center">Video games, Game design, Art, Music, Sport, Film, History</p>
    <p class="w3-center"><em>Who I am, what I enjoy - gaming, design, art, fiction, and storytelling.</em></p>
    <p>Hi, my name is Peter Deng, I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Southampton.</p>
  	<p>I have a passion for games. I am competitive and I like to look for innovation and novelty in everyday life. Not only do I love gaming and sports, I love technology and what we can do to make life interesting each day. I am a designer and developer, and this website will be a gallery of my portfolio. Not only would it be the home of my works, but I also intend to keep my thoughts, opinions, and essays here for others to see. If you find this interesting, navigate the site and have a read.</p>
    <h4 class="w3-center">Gaming</h4>
  		<p>Gaming has a history, maybe reality is all just a game, some people might like to see it that way. I enjoy the spirit of gaming, there is an artform within that on the surface appears shallow and mundane, but actually holds a complex and beautiful core with variation and eloquence that nobody sees. Gaming really does not mean much if it does not include competition, a challenge, or a goal. Because of this, gaming really reflects humans, and their needs and desires for meaning and purpose. This nuanced interaction, between players, actions, and choices is what makes gaming such a great medium, and a relevant and exciting art.</p>
  		<p>I started playing games like card games and board games initially, my first experience with video games come from Westwood Studios (now EA) Red Alert 2, which also introduced strategy games and from there on, I played puzzle games and war games, then RPGâ€™s and then FPS games in the form of Call of Duty and Medal of Honour, before jumping to Skyrim and then PC games like Dota 2, LoL and Rhythm games such as Osu!.</p>
      <p>I particularly enjoy studying gameplay and game design choices. My goal of my career is to become a games developer, something that will inspire others like how games inspired me when I was younger.</p>
      <p>I thoroughly enjoy looking at art of all kinds, I think part of making art is to be appreciated so I aspire to always appreciate the art that someone else produces great or small.</p>
      <p>I watch many films but not as much as any movie-enthusiast, the modern era of films has left a lot to be desired and seems to have regressed slowly away from an artform as much as an entertainment product, in fact the past decade of films has all but used previous stories and nothing beyond, but this could be chalked up to post-modernism and a symptom of a stagnating society, only time will tell. That being said, there are always gems that I hope to catch, I hope to write some reviews for special films that capture my interest.</p>
      <p>In my spare time I read about famous philosophers or ancient history. History is often described as a reminder of our mistakes, but I like to see history as an inspiration for our future, and a legacy of our ancestors.</p>
      <p>My favourite animals are Rabbits, Dogs and Horses, maybe one day I might choose to adopt a rabbit.</p>
      <p>I have a whole universe I dream to bring to life, to create and share with everyone. The name of this world is 'Crowlion', and I wish for it to grow into the gem that I as a kid all those years ago dreamt it would grow to be. It's funny how the aspirations and desires of adults usually ends up being little dreams of a growing child. That is all I am going to disclose for now about Crowlion. I plan on unveiling the machinations of the world through novels and games that I am working hard to come to life. I guess finally, the last thing I would like to say is, for those that are reading this, I am grateful that you were able to see a side of me I do not show to others, because if you are reading this out of the curiosity of your heart and not by the trivial pleads of a boy lost in his world, it means I made my dream come true, a dream not of my older self, but a dream that was anchored into my heart by my younger self, for that is the only dream I have now, the happiness for that child all those years ago.

        <p>I also watch a lot of anime and read manga. Discussing anime is very fun for me and hopefully someday I could produce my own anime or manga series, that would be very fun. I openly enjoy discussing anime so reach out to me if you have something to talk about!
