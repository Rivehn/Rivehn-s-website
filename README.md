# Rivehn-s-website - Current Domain: Rivehn.me
Personal site, for thoughts and ramblings

While it's nothing spectacular, I hope to at least have some place to show the personal projects and work I do myself for everyone to see.
The site has nothing special just HTML, so far. All the CSS is W3 templates that I took from the website.

Current Goals for myself: Improve HTML, Learn the CSS, add another page for blogs and fix navigation on site
