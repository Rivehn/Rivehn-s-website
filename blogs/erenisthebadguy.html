  <h3 class="w3-center">Eren is the Bad Guy:</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>The reversal of roles between Villain and Protagonist in AoT Final Season.</em></p>

  <p>The Final season has delivered expectations with it is incredible opening, tumbling suspension and ruthless violence. What the new studio has done with AoT though is very interesting, compared to the previous studio and tried to capture the manga and revamp it in the lens of an anime viewer. The main decision they have stuck with, unique or not, was to turn our stories original protagonists from the previous 3 seasons, into the antagonists.
  </p>
<p>The opening 3-4 episodes highlights this as we are introduced to the new Titan candidates and the return of Reiner. These episodes help paint how broken Reiner’s character is at this point, to near suicidal levels. The level of character development, alongside the introduction of a new set of important characters gives us the perspective of Marley but in Attack on Titan fashion, where the clarity of who is a good guy and a bad guy is unclear. Our expectations are reversed as we are forced to empathise with these new characters and what they must struggle with to survive in Marley, which parallels how Attack on Titan likes to paint sides of a war all the way back in Season 1 to the 3. This antagonism culminates in Eren’s appearance which was a fantastic way to introduce the Paradis attack.
  </p>
<p>Eren’s appearance is much more significant in countless ways to the story. An initial point to make is the way the season unfolds; no prior knowledge is actually needed of the previous 3 seasons up to this point. This is because the current season introduces all the core information the current season needs to focus on. This streamline, if intended, makes the new season seem fresh instead of repetitive to the old ones (especially the potential problem of season 1 and season 3 part 2). When we look at the important elements to the plot it will look like this: Reiner survived something traumatic, after fighting the enemies of Paradis island, we then introduced to the problems of Eldian-Marleyan relationships, we our introduced to a set of new kids that will be warriors, with particular emphasis on Falco and Gabi, the goal of Marley is the founding titan power. These elements are unique to this season and not found previous seasons. In this regard, the final season could have been a standalone anime and it would support itself well. The split between this season and previous seasons, helps consolidate the gap the final season has with previous seasons, as technology is much more advanced, weapons have changed, and fight scenes must be reimagined with how they will go.
  </p>
<p>Now returning to the point of Eren’s introduction, our first time seeing him, and our first time being revealed his character are two different times. The first time seeing him is when he talks to Falco under the name of Kruger while being actually introduced to him is when he confronts Reiner. This split is excellent for two important reasons, the first is that we as viewers should not “know” what he looks like now after four years. With careful deduction it might have been easy to tell but the show does not give any clear indication until later which makes his introduction unusual, very much how antagonists appear in other shows. This is reinforced by the fact that he was missing a leg and eye which to our current knowledge, is something we are unaware of that Eren lost. The second important point is his culmination of showing up in front of Reiner. In a somewhat villainous way, Eren decides to talk to Reiner one to one in a civilian room while the festival is occurring in the background, his reveal as Eren is critical here because it elevates the level of tension in this scene and the show itself since Willy already hinted that they will likely attack amidst the festival. His dialogue to Reiner is important too, as Eren clearly has control of the conversation with Reiner being the one replying to each sentence, Eren has the temperament of a dangerous man before finally ending the conversation and initiating the attack on Marley.
  </p>
	<p>Eren’s introduction has many ironies involved too. Initially, Eren actually speaks to his grandfather in the hospital, whether knowingly or unknowingly, but because of the attack titan’s power and his father’s books, Eren being retold of the accounts of his father’s actions and his father’s little sister is ironic as he hears how his grandfather deeply regretted those decisions to the point of mental breakdown, whereas if Grisha did not take his sister out of the walls, Grisha would never have reached Paradis island and give birth to Eren. Eren also talks about parallels between him and Reiner, whom have both suffered as Eren puts it, due to the consequences of war and violence. Reiner of course refutes this, saying he did it for glory and selfish reasons which led to the death of his friends and potentially more, even saying that Eren’s mother was killed because of the very actions of Berthold and him.
		</p>
	<p>In conclusion, I think this new studio has stomped a great foot into the attack on titan franchise and the revelations of the plot so far have been fantastic. The studio understands the important areas and tries to elevate each scene and episode with how they think the story should be revealed to us. The use of Antagonism reversal is excellent and compliments the entire story, depicting how deeply disturbing but ultimately tragic humanity can be when given the power of destruction in the use of Titan powers. I hope the season to continue with it’s current pace and my personal hope is that more will be done with the characters of Armin and Mikasa, as I think Mikasa has been quite a weak character for awhile without much self-agency or relevancy so far, and Armin because his character is very interesting, shouldering the advice of Erwin’s questionable ethical decisions, Berthold’s Nuke level powers and the potential guilt of holding such a powerful weapon in his body, will Armin eventually break from shouldering these burdens? Also, I hope the final message that Attack on Titan can really push is that there are no heroes in war, and in the end, both sides are the bad guys.
