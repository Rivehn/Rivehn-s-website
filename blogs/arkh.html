  <h3 class="w3-center">Arkh - Chaos mage</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Champion idea by Rivehn</em></p>
  <p>There are only a few in Runeterra that can be called mages, much fewer can be called Archmages.
  Some know tales of the rogue mage, Ryze, or his apprentice, the fallen fire wizard now known as Brand,
  but among these mages there is only one that all agree possesses the talent to wield magic.
  Arkh was born with the natural ability to see the flow of mana which helped him to develop his control of magic.
  Unfortunately, those with the talent, often grow arrogant and Arkh was one such student.
  Believing him to be the greatest mage that was born he challenged the great archmagi across Runeterra to duels with
  often high success until he met the mage Ryze.
  His duel with Ryze humiliated him and enlightened him to how little he knew, he became hungry for power.
  Using his talents he searched in the ruins of Shurima hoping to find
  a new source of power that others have yet to discover when unusually,
  he stumbled upon a grimoire, a strange object to find in Shurima, but with the grimoire, Arkh
  learnt of a power that he knew only he could wield, Chaos magic.
  </p>
<p>Arkh is high versatility combo mage that specialises in combo spells together to cause massive destruction.
  </p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>Passive – Chaos Orb: Every time Arkh casts a spell or item (including summoner spells)
 Arkh gains a stack of Chaos energy for 4 seconds, losing a stack every 2 seconds after 5 seconds.
 When Arkh is at 2 stacks, Arkh levitates, preventing him from being grounded and can move while channelling,
 upon reaching 4 stacks (Transcended), Arkh’s releases a chaotic surge, at 6 stacks (max/Chaos) Arkh loses control,
 casting abilities causes him to take damage but the damage is increased by 40%.
  </p>
<p>Q – Fireball – Arkh casts a ball of fire at a target area – transcended
 – the cast location burns enemies for DoT damage – Chaos – Cast location AoE is a larger circle radius.
  </p>
	<p>W – Icy blast – Channeling longer increases range, Arkh can move while channelling if levitating
		– Arkh fires a shot of ice in front of him that slows enemies for 60% for 0.5 seconds
		– Chaos – fires 5 projectiles in a cone.
		</p>
	<p>E – Tremor wave – Arkh creates a wave of mud that pushes enemies towards him –
		Transcended - the wave is instantly cast with no cast time
		- Chaos - cast location surrounds Arkh.
		</p>
	<p>R – Chaotic surge – Arkh releases a surge of lightning dropping a bolt on all enemies around
		him so powerful that it seeps into the ground causing a wave at their location dealing damage to other enemies
		– Chaos - The AoE becomes a larger circle around Arkh.
		</p>
