  <h3 class="w3-center">Aatrox – Darkin World Ender</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Whether mistaken for a demon or god, many tales have been told of the Darkin... but few know the blades real name, and the history the Darkin faced.</p>
<p>
Near the dawn of Runeterra, a mysterious meteor crashed into the dry sands of Shurima. There, 5 wicked beings emerged in a form considered alien to the residing inhabitants.
The 5 beings brought a message, written into stone with strange heiroglyphics that none of the encountering shurimans understood. Then the 5 beings transformed themselves
into 5 weapons to be wielded and gave themselves as possession for 5 warriors, these ascended warriors eventually led to the emergence of the great shuriman empire.
</p>
<p>
Aatrox was his name. He was at the vanguard of every noble conflict. So true and just was his conduct that other god-warriors would always gather at his side,
 and ten thousand mortals of Shurima marched behind him. When Setaka, the Ascended warrior-queen, called for his help against the rebellion of Icathia,
 Aatrox answered without hesitation.
</p>
<p>
But no one predicted what would come to be. Upon arriving at the front of Icathia's rebellion, Aatrox didn't find waiting enemies, but a slaughtered mass of bodies and
a twisted legion of horrific beings emerging from the rift. The void had been unleashed in the centre of the city.
</p>
<p>
After many years of desperate battle, Aatrox and his brethren finally halted the Void’s perverse advance, but the rift was unsealable. The God-warriors had no choice
but to seal Icathia in a locked timesphere, forever freezing it in time.
</p>
<p>
And in time, Shurima fell, as all empires must.
</p>
<p>
And from this downfall came the betrayal of his people. Fearing the extent of Aatrox's power and the mysterious weapon he wielded, the fallen people of Shurima turned
to fight Aatrox, but he wasn't so easily slain. It took the intervention of Targon to take down Aatrox and seal the blade. The rest of the darking fled to other parts
Runeterra, biding in time for their revival. Aatrox however was no more, and the strange blade that Aatrox wielded was buried along with Shurima's forgotten sands.
</p>
<p>
The weapon was a prison, sealing the conscious being in eternal darkness. Centuries passed... until a mortal uncovered the blade, to them a meekish small sword. They took the sword
and wielded it in battle. Eventually this mortal would die, and the sword dropped on war-ridden lands. The blade made the only choice it was bestowed, soaking in the blood
of the dying soldiers. In memory of it's betrayed fallen wielder, the blade reconstructed the vision of Aatrox. The body and mind of Aatrox was once more
but now built from the pulsating blood and flesh of the dead warriors, he was filled with vengeance. The noble warrior now appears as a hellish bloody monster wielding the
corrupted Darkin as his blade, he drenches in blood and revels in war, hoping to lead the world down a path of chaos, so that the world may relish in his suffering.
  </p>
<p>Aatrox is a powerful juggernaut, a fighter that revels in fighting and grows stronger the more he fights.
  </p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>Passive: Aatrox stores the blood of the champions he attacks in a well, giving him AD. If the well reaches full, it auto activates world ender if not on cooldown. If Aatrox suffers lethal damage, Aatrox revives by emptying his blade well.
  </p>
<p>Q – Massacre leap –
Aatrox leaps at a target with his blade, dealing AoE damage around his blade, anyone hit in the sweet spot is knocked up for 0.5 seconds. If in world ender, Aatrox flies into the air momentarily and is immune to cc and slams down a location knocking all enemies in the area up for one second.
  </p>
	<p>W – Bloodthirsty –
Passive: After attacking an enemy champion Aatrox gains movement speed for 1.5 seconds any enemy.
Active: Aatrox’s basic attack cleave enemies, dealing damage in an arc around the target, his basic attacks also heal Aatrox for a percentage and has bonus damage and range for 8 seconds.
		</p>
	<p>E – Tremor Cage –
Active: Aatrox sends a tremor that slightly slows the first enemy hit, after a moment, if the enemy champion doesn’t escape the cage in time, they are stunned for 0.5 seconds and are slowed again.
		</p>
	<p>R – World Ender –
Active: Aatrox gets monstrously large depending on how much was initially in the blade well, unfurls wings and sword enlarges. While in World Ender, Aatrox consumes the blade well continuously and stops when the blade well is empty. Killing an enemy while in world ender fills half of the current blade well.
Champion size increases, Champion range increases, gains 25% bonus attack damage, total duration with max blade well: 12 seconds
		</p>
</p>

<p>
Upon reflection of what happened to Aatrox 1.5 years ago, this is the idea of a rework I would've liked to see, both lore and kit wise. I dislike the changing of the darkin lore to a shuriman lore,
 it just feels like lazy writing and I am not a fan of removing all the mystery behind them either. It makes me less excited to see the next darkin because I know they will be shuriman.
 Sometimes showing less is better than telling more you know. My issue with his kit is that it doesn't have the same gameplay as the previous Aatrox. I wanted to try to keep much of the
  essence of that playstyle while also adding on a making it more unique. Before I'd like to say he sits as a melee carry with considerable dps, which in my envisioning of the rework, should
   be a core thing to keep inside of his kit. Likewise I wanted to make sure he still had that brutish fighter style where he fights until the end. The new Aatrox has as much to do with
   that as high mobile bruisers like Irelia or fiora. Kiting is genuinely part of his kit even if untintended. He essentially holds the role of duelist, melee carry, drain-tank and Juggernaut
   which is ridiculous for any champion to have. Not only do I dislike how they removed a champion, how they attempt to justify such a flawed kit but most of all how they treated their player-
   base over this. It's one thing to be bitter for 1.5 years but in fact the 1.5 years has just served as evidence of their incompetency to make good decisions about their game. I do hope
   this gets better, but there isn't much hope left and there certainly is more hope of a new challenger to appear, possibly by me?
