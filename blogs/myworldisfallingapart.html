  <h3 class="w3-center">My world is falling apart</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>by Rivehn</em></p>
  <p>
    My world is falling apart. It all keeps tumbling down. The music ringing in my ears will be the last thing I remember before I fall.
</p>
    <p>The man had sweat running down his face, indicating his dash over to me. Before speaking he wiped his head. Wait, don't jump, don't move, don't let go, he echoed. Wait a second, tell me, tell me what happened, what’s going on, how are you feeling?
</p>
    <p>I replied, my world has fallen apart. The vision or dream I have is unlike what the world we live in is like. As each year passed, I slowly came to understand that. My world faded and what's left was this. Therefore, I am going to end my world and leave this world.
</p>
    <p>That was the feelings I had; it wasn't all but it felt comforting to speak to someone about it.
</p>
    <p>He replies. Why must you end it all? Don't you think about your loved ones? Your friends? Are your parents still around?
</p>
    <p>Of course, he wouldn't know whether my circumstances involved anything, be it my job, my life or my friends. But alas, I said, I had many friends and a family that cared and raised me, but in the grand scheme of everything in this world, they don't matter. In the end as time passed my friends drifted away, not by intention but maybe by consequential circumstances involving me. I cared for my parents, but I don't think I can endure the pain everyday. The expectation of me to walk into this world as my own while knowing that eventually they'll disappear, and it'll be me alone to shoulder a cruel burden of reality, is one that I don’t wish to face.
</p>
    <p>So, you feel alone?
</p>
    <p>...
</p>
    <p>Yes. I feel lonely, that feeling persists even when I talk to my friends, my girlfriend, my family every day, in fact most of all with my family. When the feelings of darkness linger over me and they cannot see the incoming storm, that is when I am loneliest, where no one else matters, except me.
</p>
    <p>The man appeared to be stumped. He was at a loss for words.
</p>
    <p>I closed my eyes and braced.
</p>
    <p>He utters something quietly.
</p>
    <p>I reopen my eyes and look towards him.
</p>
    <p>Why do you have to care so much? Why can't you just, live?
</p>
    <p>A primitive question but a pure and reasonable one.
</p>
    <p>I care so much because I am cursed. From the time I became conscious I was looking out into the vast void. I was afraid of the distant stars, the vast darkness surrounding us. The notion that we were alone in this world was too much to bear. That eventually this world also will disappear likewise with me and everyone on this god forsaken planet. I chose to shut my eyes but that feeling kept returning. I was in agony every day and night, and as I grew and as I kept looking outside my window into the vast darkness...The only thing keeping that darkness company was a small orange lamp opposite my window, it reminded me of my childhood, and made me realise that we as people all just want to return back to our paradise, haven, peace, I wanted to relive those foolish ignorant times as a stupid child walking along the road by the Thames, celebrating my birthday and playing with my sister. I could not bear the realisation that it will never return, it will never happen either. And so, I stared at that darkness in hopelessness. I was mortified, I cried, because I was terrified. But you know what, I overcame that, and the one thing that snapped me back to who I was, it was an airplane, flying through the dark distant sky. I thought that there were people sitting on that vehicle, over the distant dark sky, and that is when the one aid came to save me, to help me cope. I realised I wasn't alone in the night, and with that solace I could sleep again. But that was many years ago. Now it's just a distant memory, my vision of this world has already shattered. Triggered by the foolish death of my grandfather, did I come to understand the reality of death. It returned, this time in its grander form. Eventually we will all die, and I sit and watch every day how one by one, they disappear from this world and that each day changed for me into slowly waiting for my turn. Since then, everything around me became dim, every single day became agony, every single day is agony. Where do I find the strength to cope with this pain? Was my decision, not justified? Look at me and tell me. If I continued to live on like all the people around me, would you have cared so much for me?
</p>
    <p>The man looked straight at me. Look, what you said is indeed true. We will all eventually die, the reality of this world isn't a great one either, as humans we bicker, we fight, we kill each other. We all know this already. Yet we all continue to walk and live. We do this because, it is our only choice. If the world wins in every move, then we have no other choice but to struggle to the end be it how grim that may be. But it is our choice to do so, the same way you have the choice to stand on this bridge and look towards the horizon. The moment you take that next step, reality consumes you and you no longer have a choice. We can't do anything about that, God only gave us this single choice, to live. And if we continue to live we continue to struggle. Through pain and through suffering we persevere. Why? because it's the only way to prove to God our self-worth. We aren't anything special, we are like brothers, that hate each other but must work together, because once we grow up, we only have each other left to depend on and to keep us from being lonely. Deep down, I think we are all lonely. If you share in this feeling, at least with me, then surely you can admit, that you won't be lonely anymore? That we can share in our loneliness and struggle on?
</p>
    <p>...
</p>
    <p>I took a step back. It was night and the sun had finished crossing the horizon. Red cloud began sleeping in the ambient darkness and I stepped back onto the empty bridge again. If my world is going to fall apart, I might as well stay and watch it all disappear first.
